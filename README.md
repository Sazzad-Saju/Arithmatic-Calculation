## A sample of C++ Program ##
**test first**
This program trying to add,substract,multiply and divide integer number. Then convert the input to string. Then imply string operation that is string contention(12+2=122), substraction(122-2=12), multiplication(12 * 12= 11122122) and division which is the same as substraction.
